## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - JS and React Build Tool

### What I learned

This is the first time I have used Github pages to host an app I built.
This process was a bit difficult at first since I used vite to build the app and I didnt know the process to deploy and host on github pages, below are the links I used to learn this process.

- [Deploying Vite / React App to GitHub Pages](https://reactjs.org/) - this link shows the process to deploy vite to github pages using VS Code.
- [Github Actions and Workflows](https://github.com/sitek94/vite-deploy-demo) - this repo describes the process of deploying the app and showsa workflow you can copy to help you start.

### Continued development

I will continue learning more about github and github pages until I am more comfortable using them.
